German national statistics are a thorough business. If, for example, you wanted to know
the amount of horsemeat produced in the country, the answer is right there, in table
41331-0002: 967 horses were slaughtered in December 2012, yielding 256 tons
of raw meat.

Yet there are some numbers that the government claims cannot be collected. One such
indicator is the number of people who live on the street, exposed to the cold. The burden
of estimating their number is left to a small chartiable organisation, the [Federal Working
Group on Help for the Homeless (BAG W)](http://www.bagw.de/index2.html).

Determining the numbers and background of those who have fallen through the social safety
net is by its nature a hard task. And while [BAG W estimates]( http://www.bagw.de/agstado/Statistikbericht_2011_Tabellenversion.pdf) the total number of homeless
in Germany, their data is not precise enough to support a regional breakdown. Still, I
wanted to get some idea of the regional aspect of this subject. Without quantitative
information, the next stop was a qualitative approach: since 1997, BAG W is collecting
press clippings on homeless people that have frozen to death. While these cases cannot
be taken as hard evidence, they do illustrate a pattern.

On the technical side, the map was a simple project and a good opportunity to familiarize
myself with the publishing process for interactive graphics at SpOn. Having gone through
this process gives me a better appreciation of the different components and processes
involved.
